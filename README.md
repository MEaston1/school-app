# school-app

Note: This app has not been maintained for several months and i also got locked out of the throw-away gmail to access the firebase account so expect bugs.
Secondly, the people in the screenshots are not real users but fake accounts i used to test and document the app. 

This parent-teacher communications app called Parent Connect was my dissertation project that involves two way communication and announcement (one way) communication methods.

App uses: Firebase Authenticaion, database and Storage services, Dexter file permissions, CRUD operations, hdodenhof's circleImageView library   
App features include: two-way communications between all users, abesence forms, school-trip permission forms and medical forms, splash screen, navigation bar,
status updates through progress cards and more, such as user permission levels with the ability to view and delete student medical forms through a teacher-only area of the app.

This app makes use of the MVVM structure across almost all features within the app for message lists, contact lists, announcements/article lists and forms lists.
